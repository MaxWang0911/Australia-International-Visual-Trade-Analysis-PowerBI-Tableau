#  Australian International Trade Visual Analytics (1988–2024)

This project presents a comprehensive visual analytics report on over three decades of Australian international trade, using official data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The analysis spans from 1988 to 2024 and is built using **Tableau** and **Microsoft Power BI**, covering 10 major trade categories and 67 subcategories.

## 📊 Objectives
- Identify long-term trends, structural patterns, and volatility across import/export data
- Examine Australia’s reliance on specific trade sectors, especially Category 7 (Machinery and Transport Equipment)
- Provide visual storytelling through dashboards and storyboards
- Deliver policy-relevant insights for enhancing trade resilience and industrial self-sufficiency

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau** – For dashboards and storyboards, excellent for storytelling and stakeholder communication
- **Power BI** – For advanced data modelling, forecasting (using DAX), and custom measures
- **Python & R scripts** – Used for selected statistical visualisations in Power BI

## 📁 Files Included
- `14403000_A3.pbix` – Power BI dashboard file
- `14403000_A3.twbx` – Tableau packaged workbook
- `report.pdf` – Full analysis report (includes screenshots, commentary, and forecasts)
- `README.md` – This file

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Category 7 (Machinery & Transport Equipment)** consistently drives trade deficits, accounting for ~40% of all imports.
- **Category 3 (Mineral Fuels)** has led Australia’s trade surplus but shows high volatility due to global price shifts.
- Subcategory 78 (Road Vehicles) alone accounts for ~50% of imports in Category 7—an indicator of Australia's dependency on vehicle imports.
- Power BI and Tableau forecasts both suggest continued growth in road vehicle imports, with policy implications on industrial self-reliance.

## 📈 Visuals Used
- Line Charts, Ribbon Charts, Boxplots, Heatmaps
- Bubble Charts: YoY Growth vs Volatility
- Interactive Filters and Drill-downs by Category/Subcategory
- Forecast Models (Power BI: DAX-based; Tableau: Exponential Smoothing)

## ✅ Recommendations
- Invest in domestic high-tech manufacturing (esp. EVs and components)
- Reduce trade dependency on volatile sectors through diversification
- Support infrastructure and freight reform to strengthen trade efficiency
