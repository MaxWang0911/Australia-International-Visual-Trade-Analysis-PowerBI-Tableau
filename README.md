## 🔍 Project Problem

Australia's international trade plays a critical role in its economic performance. However, trade performance varies significantly across product categories and time periods.  
This project aims to answer:

- Which product categories are driving trade growth or decline?
- Are there shifting patterns in category composition over time?
- Which subcategories warrant policy attention or intervention?

---

## 🧠 Analytical Approach

### 1. 🧹 Data Preparation & Modeling (Excel + Power BI)

- **Source**: Australia trade statistics (multi-year, category-level)
- **Cleaned & structured** in Excel to standardize:
  - Import/export values (millions)
  - Time dimensions (months/years)
  - Category & subcategory identifiers
- **Modelling in Power BI**:
  - Star schema with separate fact & dimension tables
  - Time intelligence using DAX
  - Measures: YoY change, subcategory share, rolling totals

### 2. 📊 Visual Analytics

#### 📌 Power BI Highlights:
- **Line charts** for YoY growth trends by category
- **Stacked area charts** for share evolution of subcategories
- **Decomposition trees** to drill down from category to subcategory
- **Forecasting & clustering** via analytics pane

#### 📌 Tableau Highlights:
- Dynamic dashboards with filters by region & category
- Parameter controls for time period selection
- Animated trend lines across time windows

## 💡 Recommendations

- 🎯 **Policy Priority**: Focus on Category 7, especially Subcategory 78. Its subcategory strength contrasts with the parent category weakness.
- 🔄 **Diversification Strategy**: Encourage emerging subcategories in Categories 2 & 9 with consistent growth.
- 📉 **Deprioritise**: Categories showing long-term stagnation (e.g. Category 4) may not warrant further subsidies or negotiation.
